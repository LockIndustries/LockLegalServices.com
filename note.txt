       About 70 million Americans have criminal records. Most of these people are good hardworking people who simply made a mistake. However, our criminal justice system is formal and foreign, which can make facing a charge even scarier than it should otherwise be!

       Our mission as trial attorneys is to serve as both an advocate, fighting to get you the best possible outcome, and as a counselor, guiding you through the process with as little confusion and worry as possible!
