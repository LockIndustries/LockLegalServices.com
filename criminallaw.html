      <h1>Speeding Tickets</h1>
        </br>
          <p>
          As drivers, we all make mistakes from time to time. Even though the majority of traffic accidents and violations are minor, some traffic incidents can have major consequences and long-term impacts in your life. Here at Locker Law Office we work to protect our clients from higher insurance rates, suspension of driving privileges, and unnecessary jail sentences that can arise from traffic tickets.
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
          While admitting guilt and paying the fine is the right course of action for many tickets, the fees for these violations can become very upsetting. If contesting the ticket is the right course of action in your case, you could wind up saving a lot in fines and fees. Scheduling a free consult now and find out if your ticket should be fought.

      <h1>Drug Charges</h1>
        </br>
          <p>
          Although drug crimes are common in Illinois, they are still treated as very serious charges. Penalties range widely depending on whether you have been charged with the same or a similar crime in the past, as well as the type of drug and the amount in question. Drug crimes are defined and explained in the Illinois Controlled Substances Act (720 ILCS 570). Charges could include possession, distribution, manufacture and trafficking of drugs. Even with a prescription, medical drugs used in an illegal manner could result in charges. We at the Locker Law Office are committed to assist you in protecting your rights and establishing your defenses early on to get the best possible result.
          </p>
        </br></br>



      <h1>Drunk Driving</h1>
        </br>
          <p>
          Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense that typically results in suspended driver's licenses, community service, jail time, and severe fines. Sometimes the police make mistakes too, and your arrest could be based on inadequate evidence or simply an error. Sometimes the police fail to account for medical conditions and machine calibration. There are many defense strategies available and massive risks, so hiring an aggressive defense attorney can be very important.
          </p>
        </br></br>



      <h1>Drugged Driving</h1>
        </br>
            <h2>
            What is Drugged Driving?
            </h2><p>
            <b>Drugged Driving:</b> A person can be arrested for driving under the influence of drugs, if the person was driving, or in actual physical possession of a vehicle while:
          </p>
        </br>
            <ol>
                <li>under the influence of anyother drugor combination of drugs to a point that leaves the driver incapable of driving safely; or </li>
                <li>there is any amount of a drug, substance, or compound in the person’s breath, blood, or urine resulting from the unlawful useor consumption of drugs.</li>
            </ol>
          </br>
            <p>
            <b>For Medicinal Cannabis:</b>A person can be arrested for driving under the influence of medicinal marijuana, if within 2 hours of driving, or being in actual physical possession of a vehicle:
          </p>
        </br>
          <ol>
              <li>the concentration of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol) in that person’s blood is 5 nanograms; or </li>
              <li>the concentration of THC in that person’s other bodily fluids is 10 nanograms or greater; or </li>
              <li>any amount of THC in any of that person’s bodily fluids, ifa driver is incapable of driving safely. </li>
          </ol>
        </br>
          <p>
          <b>Penalties:</b> The penalties for drugged DUI are the same as for an alcohol DUI. First and second offences are usually misdemeanors with possible prison terms of up to one year; while third and subsequent offences are felonies, with possible prison terms of up to three years.
          </p>
        </br>
          <p>
          Additionally, Illinois’ implied consent will automatically suspend a defendant’s license for refusing to take or complete a sobriety test, or for failing one.Having an attorney by your side when facing DUI charges can make a significant difference in how the charges impact your life.
          </p>

      <h1>General Criminal Defense</h1>

          There are many criminal offenses that could threaten your freedom and future, and the penalties range from small fines to hard prison time.
