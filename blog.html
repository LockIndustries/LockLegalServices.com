        <h3>I Want My Attorney!</h3>
        <h5>April 29, 2018</h5>

      </br>
        <p>
        Most of us have seen the courtroom movies. Law and Order led to an era where nearly everyone can recite there "Miranda" rights from memory and everyone knows that they can ask for an attorney. However, if you are ever arrested there is one thing you may not know!
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        Let's say you are walking down the street and you cross the street outside of a crosswalk. The police stop you, arrest you for jaywalking and then begin to question you about a local unsolved murder. . . .  Time to get a Lawyer? . . .  YES!!
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        So you say, "I think I am gonna ask for my lawyer." the officers look at you, laugh, and then interrogate you continuously until you confess. . . . What went wrong?
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        The problem is that the request for an attorney wasn't "clear" enough. Yep, that's right, if you want to take advantage of your right to an attorney. You must be unequivocal in the request. Which means you need to ask so directly, that no one can honestly say you simply "indicated you were thinking about it."
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        SO words to live by: I Want My Attorney!
        </p>
        </br>
        <p>
        As a reminder once you have asserted you right to an attorney and said those four magical words, the police must stop all questioning until your attorney gets there. These rights exist to protect the people from the government, when the government oversteps. Don't be afraid to take full advantage of your rights. Keep Calm and Call Your Lawyer!
